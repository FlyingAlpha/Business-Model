A business model is the framework or plan that an organization uses to create, deliver, and capture value in order to generate revenue and sustain its operations. It outlines how the business operates, its target market, its revenue streams, its cost structure, and its value proposition. A well-defined business model provides clarity on how a company will create and deliver its products or services to its customers, and how it will make money from those offerings. Business models can be simple or complex and can vary significantly between industries and business types.
